# Custom CSS

This App let's you add a chunk of custom CSS directly from the admin interface of Enonic XP - Content Studio. The CSS you write will be injected into the `<head>` portion of your website, wrapped in a proper `<style>` tag.

Warning! This CSS will be added after the page is processed, so minification of it will not work unless that is triggered after rendering.

## Usage

Just add the app to any site, and then edit its configuration and write your CSS. Save to preview your changes, and be sure to publish to let your visitors see the result!

Pro tip! Use the `deactivate` checkbox if you temporarily need to remove your custom CSS from all the pages instead of uninstalling the app (which would make you lose your custom CSS).

## Disclaimer

This app is not designed to be a permanent solution for adding CSS, you should always add your CSS to the core site app instead. However, for quick and temporary testing or prototyping this app can help you try things out faster.
