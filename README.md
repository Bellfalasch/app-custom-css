# Custom CSS

This App let's you add a chunk of custom CSS directly from the admin interface of Enonic XP - Content Studio.

Warning! This CSS will be added after the page is processed, so minification of it will not work unless that is triggered after rendering.

## Usage

Just add the app to any site, and then edit its configuration and write your CSS. Save and publish!
